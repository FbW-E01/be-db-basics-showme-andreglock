# Backend - Database Basics - Show Me

You are planning to build an app where users can add poems anonymously. You want to have _some_ data regarding the poem, but nothing that can be used to identify the user. Before even starting, try to think about the data you will be handling. You (as an administrator) are allowed to edit the poems.

You could take some inspiration from here; https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/152825/

- What data to save? 
    - Title, body (as short text), (and date if space is not an issue)
- Which types of fields would you have? Do you need dates? 
    - Tittle and body (input text and textarea), no need to input the date as it could be created in the back end if need be.
- Estimate how much data will you allow to be saved 
    - Up to 60 chars for title and up to 2000 chars (very long poem) for the body.
- Describe the data in whatever way you find best
- Show how you would create the table(s) for your data
    - CREATE TABLE <name> (<title> <varchar>(50),<body> <varchar>(2000),<date> <varchar>(16));
- Add Value:
    - INSERT INTO <name> VALUES('Poem title', 'Poem body', '16-08-2021');

It was August 1977 when Elvis Presley fell
face down on his Graceland bathroom floor;
by the time paramedics arrived, he was cold and blue. I knew this because I was with
my grandmother, Belle, who called her sister, Geraldine, who came over at once so we 
could watch the news. My grandmother knew Elvis liked peanut butter on white bread
with American cheese, eaten in his jungle room which had Tiki chairs, fur lampshades,
a waterfall. Other neighbors arrived: omen in short skirts, women who brought with them more of the food Elvis
loved: coconut cakes, fried chicken, bacon. Elvis was dead, and summer had been so
hot the things we touched burned our hands: handles of garden hoses, car doors, the metal swing set my grandfather
built for me on the back lawn. I listened to the sound of southern women's voices expressing disbelief; they said I swan
and I pictured something rippling and solitary; they said Well, shut my mouth and I saw blue Elvis, falliIt was August 1977 when Elvis Presley fell face down on his Graceland bathroom floor; by the time paramedics arrived, he was
